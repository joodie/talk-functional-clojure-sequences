These are the slides I used for my presentation at the Amsterdam
Clojurians meeting of 9 March, 2011.

The file talk.clj contains the slides as ^L (page break) separated
pages of clojure code. Note that github.com doesn't currently display
page break characters in source view; download the raw file or clone
the project and open it in Emacs to see them.

The project.clj file contains the leiningen config so you can run the
code interactively using SLIME/swank-clojure.

The related emacs code to navigate and show each page in a huge font
is at https://github.com/joodie/emacs-simple-slides
